README

  in makeTf2Bind.py call writeBindFile to generate a bind config file.

  for more information on the parameters of writeBindFile, see comments
  above the function.

  see example input files:       cuiltheory.txt   and   cuiltheorycut.txt
  and resulting output files:    cuiltheory1.cfg  and   cuiltheory2.cfg

------------- cuiltheory1.cfg was generated from cuiltheory.txt ----------------
  cuiltheory.txt is raw copypaste text of the cuil theory reddit comment
  (https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7da5i/police_raids_reveal_baby_farms/c06cqxb)

------------- cuiltheory2.cfg was generated from cuiltheorycut.txt -------------
  cuiltheorycut.txt is the first 4 cuils of cuil theory text i spaced into line
  phrases that roughly make sense and are <= 127 characters long per line.
  if you want to divide your file int <= 127 character lines by hand,
  feel free to do it. my code will not mess with your partitioning.

  example function calls are at bottom of makeTf2Bind.py
