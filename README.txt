README

  in makeTf2Bind.py call writeBindFile to generate a bind config file.
  for more information on the parameters of writeBindFile, see comments
  above the function.

  if you want to divide your file int <= 127 character lines by hand,
  feel free to do that. my code will not mess with your partitioning.

  see example input files:       cuiltheory.txt   and   cuiltheorycut.txt
  and resulting output files:    cuiltheory1.cfg  and   cuiltheory2.cfg

  example function calls are at bottom of makeTf2Bind.py
